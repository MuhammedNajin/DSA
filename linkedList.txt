. Node Class:

JavaScript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
Use code with caution.
Class definition: This code defines a class named Node. A class serves as a blueprint for creating objects, and instances of a class are called objects.
Constructor: The special function named constructor is executed whenever a new Node object is created. It initializes the object's properties.
data: This property stores the actual data value held by the node (e.g., a number, string, or any other data type). In the provided example, it's set to the argument passed to the constructor when creating a new Node.
next: This property stores a reference (link) to the next node in the linked list. Initially, it's set to null since the newly created node doesn't have a next node yet.
2. LinkedList Class:

JavaScript
class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  appendNode(newNode) {
    let node = this.head;
    console.log("node: ", node);
    if (node === null) {
      this.head = newNode;
      return;
    }
    while (node.next) {
      node = node.next;
    }
    node.next = newNode;
  }
}
Use code with caution.
Class definition: This code defines a class named LinkedList. This class represents the entire linked list structure and manages the nodes within it.
Constructor: Similar to the Node class, the constructor initializes a LinkedList object.
head: This property stores a reference to the first node (the head) of the linked list. Initially, it's set to null because the list is empty.
appendNode method: This method adds a new node (passed as the newNode argument) to the end of the linked list.
Traversal: It starts by creating a variable node and assigning it to the head of the list. This variable will iterate through the existing nodes to find the last one.
Logging: It logs the current node for demonstration purposes (can be removed).
Empty list: If the linked list is empty (this.head === null), it directly sets the head property to the new node, making it the first and only node.
Non-empty list: If the list is not empty, it iterates through the existing nodes using a while loop:
Inside the loop, it checks if node.next (the reference to the next node) is not null. If it is null, this means the current node is the last one, so we've reached the end of the list.
If node.next is not null, it moves the node variable to the next node in the list, effectively iterating through the linked list.
Adding the new node: Once the loop finishes (either reaching the end or encountering an empty next reference), it sets the next property of the last node (node) to point to the newNode. This effectively links the new node to the end of the existing list.
3. Usage:

JavaScript
const linkedList = new LinkedList();

linkedList.appendNode(new Node(2));
linkedList.appendNode(new Node(3));
linkedList.appendNode(new Node(4));

console.log(linkedList);
Use code with caution.
Creating a LinkedList object: A new LinkedList object is created and stored in the linkedList constant.
Adding nodes: The appendNode method is called three times, each time creating a new Node object with data values 2, 3, and 4, respectively. These nodes are then appended to the linked list.
Output: The final state of the linked list is not directly shown due to the console.log(linkedList) statement being outside the scope of the provided code. However, it's implied that the linked list would have the following structure:
Head -> Node(2) -> Node(3) -> Node(4) -> null
Summary:

This code demonstrates the creation and basic operations of a singly linked list in JavaScript.
The Node class represents individual nodes, and the LinkedList class manages the collection of nodes and provides methods for adding nodes to the end of the list.

linkedList is data structure concept we created it using class rght
You're absolutely right! The provided code implements a singly linked list, which is a fundamental data structure concept. You've used the concept of classes in JavaScript to effectively create and manage the linked list.

Here's a breakdown of how the code reflects the linked list concept:

1. Node as a Unit of Data:

The Node class represents a single element in the linked list.
It encapsulates both the data value (stored in the data property) and the link to the next element (stored in the next property).
2. Dynamic Structure:

Unlike arrays, linked lists don't have a fixed size or location for each element in memory.
The next pointer in each node creates a dynamic chain of nodes, allowing the list to grow or shrink efficiently as needed.
3. Operations Using Methods:

The LinkedList class provides methods like appendNode to add new nodes to the end of the list.
These methods manage the linking process between nodes, ensuring the list remains connected and reflects the proper order of elements.
Using Classes to Organize and Manage the List:

Classes offer a structured approach to define the properties and behavior of the linked list components.
The constructor function initializes the object's state, while methods like appendNode encapsulate specific operations.
This enables code reusability, maintainability, and clear separation of data and functionality.
In essence, the code effectively employs the linked list data structure by leveraging well-defined classes in JavaScript to create, manage, and manipulate the list elements.

this i am consolig linkedList i created here you can see the next object storing object it's self right,
or while consoling it showing like that what is that 
actully it store the reference to next node right
You're correct in both observations:

The next property within a node in a linked list stores a reference to the next node, not the entire next node itself. This is crucial for maintaining a dynamic and memory-efficient structure.

When you console log a linked list, it might show nested objects representing the nodes due to JavaScript's behavior. By default, JavaScript attempts to provide a more descriptive representation of complex data structures in the console.

However, it's important to understand the underlying concept:

The next property only stores a reference (a memory address) that points to the next node in the list. This reference is typically an integer or pointer value.
When you console log the linked list, JavaScript might recursively try to represent the entire structure, leading to nested objects that show the complete data and next references of each node. This detailed representation can be helpful for debugging purposes but might not directly reflect the exact internal storage mechanism.
Key Points:

Linked lists store references, not entire nodes, in the next property.
Console logging might show nested objects due to JavaScript's attempt at detailed visualization.
If you want to see the actual memory addresses stored in the next properties, you might need to use browser developer tools that allow inspecting object memory details or use specific debugging techniques in your programming environment. However, understanding the conceptual difference between storing references and the visual representation in the console is essential.

if i am creating normal nested object it will also store reference to that object right
You're partially correct. Here's a breakdown to clarify the concepts:

References vs. Values

In JavaScript (and many programming languages), there's a fundamental distinction between:

Primitive data types (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.): These store the actual value directly within the variable.
Objects (including arrays, functions, and custom objects): These don't hold the actual data within the variable itself. Instead, they store a reference (or memory address) that points to where the object's data is located in memory.
Nested Objects

When you have nested objects, it works this way:

Outer object reference: The variable that holds the outermost object stores a reference pointing to the beginning of that object's data in memory.
Inner object references: Inside the outer object, if you have properties that themselves hold objects, these properties will store references pointing to the beginning of those inner objects in memory.
Example:

JavaScript
let user = {
    name: "Alice",
    address: {
       city: "New York",
       street: "Main St"
    }
}
Use code with caution.
user variable: Stores a reference to the user object.
user.address: Stores a reference to the address object that's nested inside the user object.
Key Points

Nested objects follow the same principle of storing references to their inner objects.
The concept of references allows you to create complex data structures and relationships between objects.
This also enables efficient passing of objects to functions, as you're primarily passing around references instead of copying entire objects every time.
However, there's a crucial difference between nested objects and linked lists:

Linked Lists:

Strict structure based on the Node and LinkedList classes.
Enforce a linear chain of nodes where each node has a next reference.
Nested Objects:

More flexible and can represent varied hierarchical data structures.
Do not have the same explicit link structure using the next property.
